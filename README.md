# -EDA-HR-Analytics
Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Engagement &amp; HR Metrics using Python.


🔍 **Just Completed: HR Analytics EDA Project!**

I performed an in‑depth exploratory analysis on the **Human Resources Dataset** from Kaggle to uncover key employee engagement patterns and HR trends.

📊 **Key Results:**
• Max leaves taken: 20 by ~4.5% of employees  
• 70 employees without any special project  
• Salary distribution shows high gaps at the top and tight clustering at the bottom
